# ScrabbleGame

## Overview
Welcome to "ScrabbleGame," my very first coding project, developed exclusively in C without the use of any libraries or frameworks. This project represents the starting point of my journey in computer programming. Although my skills have significantly advanced since this project, it holds a special place as a legacy piece showcasing my early learning and development in coding.

## Project Description
ScrabbleGame is a simple implementation of the classic Scrabble board game. It was created as an exercise in fundamental programming concepts using the C programming language. This project was an opportunity to explore basic data structures, algorithms, and the intricacies of the C language in a practical, hands-on way.

## Key Features
- **Basic Implementation of Scrabble**: Simulates the core gameplay mechanics of Scrabble.
- **Pure C Language**: Written entirely in C, focusing on basic structures and algorithms without external libraries.

## Installation
To compile and run ScrabbleGame, you'll need a C compiler installed on your system. Follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Whyiest/ScrabbleGame.git
   ```
2. Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).
3. Run the compiled executable to start the game.

## Usage
This project is a testament to my initial steps in programming. It serves as an educational tool for those who are beginning to learn C and are interested in seeing how fundamental concepts can be applied to create a functional game.

## Reflecting on Growth
While this project may be simple compared to my current capabilities, it reflects the invaluable learning process every developer undergoes. It serves as a reminder of where I started and how far I have come.
